I work with systems, documentation, and ideas that benefit from clarity and restraint.

Much of my interest lies in how complex systems fail quietly, how explanations drift from reality, and how structure can recover meaning without noise.

Technical work has trained me to value durability over cleverness. Cultural work has trained me to distrust systems that perform certainty without understanding.

I prefer tools, writing, and explanations that remain useful after their context has faded.
